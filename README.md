*   **Component-Based Architecture:** Built with reusable React components for maintainability and scalability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ⚛️
*   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. 📝
*   **Vite:** A fast build tool that provides a lightning-fast development experience. ⚡
